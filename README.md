# Find The Pairs üÉè  

Find The Pairs is a simple memory match game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was previously available on my portfolio 1.0 but is no longer featured in my new portfolio 2.0, as it is an older project.  

## Features  

- **Dynamic Grid Layout**: Adjusts based on the number of selected cards.  
- **Randomized Gameplay**: Animal icons are shuffled for each game.  
- **Win Detection**: Alerts the player when all pairs are matched.  
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes.
